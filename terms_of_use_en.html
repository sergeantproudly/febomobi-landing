				<ul>
					<li>mobile Internet provision;</li>
					<li>international calls provision.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To use the mobile Febo.mobi Application, the User should download and install it to his/her mobile device. Likewise, the User should register an Account, in order to use our Services, review the statistics of the used Services, receive Cashback, manage an Account, check and update the personal data, and for other related purposes. You acknowledge and understand that you shall comply with the Terms, from the moment of your Febo.mobi Account registration on the website <a href="https://febo.mobi/">https://febo.mobi/</a> or in the Febo.mobi Application.</p>
				<p>You can use the Febo.mobi Application and Services without the assigned Febo.mobi phone number and without the Febo.mobi SIM card. You can use the Services via Wi-Fi network and/or via Internet provided by another operator.</p>
				<p>If you purchased the Febo.mobi SIM card, the SIM card codes (PIN1, PIN2, PUK1, PUK2) should be kept confidential. Also, in case of loss and/or theft of the SIM card, you should notify the Company as quickly as you become aware of that, by email: <a href="mailto:help@febo.mobi">help@febo.mobi</a>, or by phone: +357 253 04 68, or via the live support chat in the Application.

The Company provides its Services only on a pre-payment basis and in the amount of pre-payment. The Company is entitled to suspend or terminate the Services provision, without prior notification of the Subscriber, if the Subscriber’s balance is insufficient to cover the Services provision. The Company will restore the Services provision once the balance is (re)charged with the prepayment.</p>
				<p>The Company cannot bear responsibility for any delay upon the funds crediting to the Subscriber’s balance, nor for the payments to another or third party already carried out by the Subscriber’s error.</p>
				<p>We may unilaterally change the Subscriber’s charges and rates, placing such updates on the website or in the Febo.mobi Application at least 30 (thirty) days prior to such changes. You are responsible for being acquainted with any amended or updated version of the Terms placed on our website or in the Application.</p>


				<h2>MOBILE INTERNET PROVISION</h2>
				<p>When using the Febo.mobi SIM card, the User gets the opportunity to purchase affordable Internet packages abroad, in accordance with the rate and description of the package offered. Mobile Internet from Febo.mobi is available after the SIM card is registered/activated.</p>
				<p>We divide countries available for mobile Internet connection into 4 (four) Areas. Countries of the same Area are charged at a single-tariff rate.</p>
				<p>The Company provides its Services solely in countries included in the countries list, as specified on our website or in the Febo.mobi Application.</p>
				<p>You can purchase Internet packages for any and all Areas. When buying an Internet package in one of countries affixed to a specific Area, this Internet package shall work in all countries affixed to this specific Area.</p>
				<p>At that, geolocation is changed and displayed on the main screen in the respective Internet package circle.</p>
				<p>Operation of a specific Internet package (e.g., Area 1) is highlighted with a green tick mark. Internet packages are not highlighted without active online connection.</p>
				<p>A tariff plan of the Internet package has a specific validity period. Unused MBs of the Internet package that were not used during that term are not transferable to the following validity period.</p>
				<p>In detail, the options for mobile Internet tariff plans, charges and rates are specified in the description of the package on our website <a href="https://febo.mobi/">https://febo.mobi/</a> or in the Febo.mobi Application.</p>

				<ul>

					<li>2nd option – a call made through the Application using a Febo.mobi SIM card with the Internet package activated. This way, when a call is carried out the Febo.mobi mobile Internet is used. In this case, calls are charged at a special reduced rate</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To receive incoming calls, the Subscriber should get the Febo.mobi phone number connected. Incoming calls to the Febo.mobi number are charge-free for the Subscriber.</p>
